            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>WE whoſe names are ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, Members of the Army, under the command of the right Honorable THOMAS Lord FAIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FAX, Captain Generall of all the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Forces in the Kingdom of England, being by the providence of God brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116631:3"/>the Northern parts of this Kingdom, to oppoſe the common enemy, and the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Peace, both of this and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Scotland: And being given to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, by good hands, the ſad and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition of the godly and well-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, our Brethren in Scotland, by reaſon of the height and inſolency of Malignants there; and through the goodneſſe of God ſympathizing with their condition (as if it were our own) in this day of their ſuffering and perſecution: We are induced hereby to declare the integrity of our hearts, and the ſincerity of our intentions towards them.</p>
            <p>That, as it pleaſed God to move the hearts of the godly there to yield relief and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the well-affected of this Kingdom, in the day of our diſtreſſe; we cannot but remember the ſame with all thankfulneſſe, and own it as an obligation upon our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, to endeavour all poſſible aſſiſtance unto them, which may fall within our poor powers, as ſome ſmall return of that kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of theirs, never to be forgotten by us;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116631:3"/>And although through the policy of Satan, and the workings of ſome ungodly men, there have bin monſtrous Repreſentations of us to them, and many of them to us, whereby to divide us, and (as we have found by woful experience) thereby to gain the greater advantage againſt both, for our mutu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l ruin: Yet we doubt not but God will clear the name and innocency of both to each other, yea that we are Brethren; and notwithſtanding there may be ſome difference in things not Fundamental, (through the various meaſures of light diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penc'd by God) yet in the main we judg we all agree, unfeinedly deſiring that the Goſpel of our Lord and Savior Jeſus Chriſt, might in its own power and glory take upon the hearts of all men ſo, as there might be one profeſſor amongſt us in word only, but in deed alſo, and that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the world thereof by a holy and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous converſation towards God and man.</p>
            <p>We do declare from our hearts, as in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116631:4"/>preſence of God who knows them, that we would not give any countenance or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to any way or thing that ſhould be cleared to us to be Error, or contrary to the mind of Chriſt; and if any thing be held by us, or any amongſt us, that is ſo, it would be the rejoycing of our ſouls to have that diſcovered to us, and by the power of the Lords holy Spirit our ſelves or others to be reduced from it.</p>
            <p>We are ſo far from ſeeking to ſupplant the Government by Presbytery, that (if all power were given into our hands, (we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe before the Almighty Jehovah;) rather then to diſturb thoſe who therein wait upon God, as on the worſhip which they in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience hold to be according to his Will; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> we could ingage our lives to deliver them from the hands of any that would compel them to another Form: And all that we ſhould deſire for our particulars, is but the like Freedom; not that we ask any liberty to ſin, to prophaneſſe, looſeneſſe or ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of any kind, contrary to the Word
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116631:4"/>and Will of God. That which through the goodneſs of God we account our Crown, and our glory, is to be ſerviceable in our generations; and if it may ſeem meet to him to uſe us in this great work now on foot, as a ſuccour or refreſhment to his people in any place, that very thing would be a ſweet recompence of reward to us; yea we take pleaſure to hazard our lives, to the uttermoſt, in this work, though it ſhould be our portion, when the peace of others ſhall be redeemed (by us inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,) from their Captivity, our ſelves to be led into it: And if after all this we ſhall be found, or thought to be a burden, we truſt we ſhal be enabled quietly to ſubmit to any ſuffering or condition, unto which the good Hand of our God ſhall lead us.</p>
